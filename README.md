# Weather App

Weather telling website made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It reads your location and uses the coordinates to find a weather report. I tried to make it as comfy as I could.

### Features

* Very comfy UI.
* Finds your location based on your IP address.
* Fetches data from closest weather station.
